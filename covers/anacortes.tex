Hello!

I'm David, and I am a C\textsuperscript{{$\sharp$}} developer in Denver, CO.
Currently, I'm the project manager and development lead of a large-scale
WPF application for fire protection engineers. I love making software, but
only as a direct extension of my passion for solving problems! While my
primary experience is in C\textsuperscript{{$\sharp$}} and C++, I'm also either
proficient in or have at least dabbled in about a bajillion other languages,
paradigms, methodologies, etc.

I would be remiss in ignoring the possiblility of the entirety of the San Juan
archipelago sinking below the waves a la Atlantis, so I require some assurances
that you won't let that happen. Or maybe a houseboat. I haven't decided.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}
