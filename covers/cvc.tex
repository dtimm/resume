Hello!

I'm David, and I am looking to break in to software development. I don't have a
lot of work experience programming (though I do have some,  with
C\textsuperscript{{$\sharp$}}.NET, back in 2009), but I got my start programming
games on my TI-81, so I've been writing code for a long time. My favorite part
about it is the constant supply of small, interesting problems to solve.

While the vast majority of my work experience doesn't seem to apply to a
development job much more than "knows how to use a computer," virtually all of
it is really just the same stuff: finding technical problems and kicking them
in the teeth by typing and clicking a bit. Solved the problem already once?
Well, use that solution again, but make it better this time!

Since I don't know much about the culture of CVC, I can only say that I used to
really enjoy going out for spicy pad thai at US Thai, and I would enjoy it once
more.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
