Hello! I am David, and I have been writing software (professionally) for the last ten years. I have spent some time in startups after I six years working on large scale distributed systems at VMware (neé Pivotal). Before that, I spent three years developing Windows applications for safety-critical building systems (fire protection! in C#!). I have experience and expertise across multiple languages, and I am always excited to expand my (excellent) skill-set.

I have most of 2024 vigorously scratching an itch to learn embedded systems. I taught myself Rust (enough to be dangerous... there are even some macros!), joined a makerspace, got some hardware, and built a WIZARD STAFF. Yeah, it can connect to the wifi. Yeah, it flashes red and white lights so you can cross the streets at night without getting run down by a passing griffin. It's CNC'd wood and brass and beauty (and I2C running along the inside).

At Pivotal, later VMware, finally Broadcom (yeah, ugh), I worked on diverse projects—contributing to a distributed email alert generator, enhancing logging and metrics infrastructure for Pivotal’s Kubernetes offering, and developing distributable CI for Cloud Foundry deployments. My work was recognized with a delightfully convoluted [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11240127B1/en) for a declarative software monitoring scheme (good luck!). Collaboration and delivering value quickly without compromising long-term quality were the cornerstones of my work, where I extensively used Golang and tackled endless YAML configurations.

Long ago, I wrote CAD software for fire protection tradesfolk. I advocated for testing, git, and modernization. I rewrote a bunch of C++ hydraulic calculation software in C# (and found just... so many memory errors in the process), and we used that to launch a product (AutoSPRINK RVT) that is still a Big Deal in that world. This included simulating hydraulic systems, managing distribution and licenses, and 3D rendering.

In short, I absolutely love this stuff. I've played and worked with computers my whole life, starting with a TI-81 calculator, and I cannot fathom stopping (even if computers get better at it than us... I mean, there are already people better at it than me, and I do it anyways!).

Regards,

David Timm
