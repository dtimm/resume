Hello,

My name is David, and I have been working with large-scale distributed systems for the last six years. Before that, I spent three years developing Windows applications for safety-critical building systems. I have experience and expertise across multiple languages, and I am always excited to expand my skill-set.

At Pivotal (and later VMware after an acquisition), I worked on many projects. I contributed to a distributed email alert generator, logging and metrics infrastructure for Pivotal's Kubernetes offering, distributable CI for Cloud Foundry deployments, and several other products. I was awarded a patent for work developing a declarative software monitoring scheme and the associated software. My time at Pivotal was highly collaborative, with a focus on delivering value quickly without compromising long-term quality. I worked extensively in Golang writing backend services, with (seemingly endless!) YAML for configuration.

Before that, I worked on computer-aided design software for fire suppression systems. This work included simulation of hydraulic systems and associated reporting, distribution and license management, and 3D rendering. After a year, I led the effort to expand the product portfolio with a new offering, AutoSPRINK RVT, which is still sold by the company today.

Thank you for your consideration,
David Timm
