Hello,

The confluence of software scaling and biology at Culture is really exciting
to me. I want to bring my expertise in software to a transforming and
transformative organization.

Software engineering has been an obvious part of me since I was a child writing
games for my graphing calculator, but I came later to biochemistry. I decided
to go back to school while working as a software engineer to expand my
horizons, and a degree in the sciences was a given. I spent a couple years
pursuing a physics degree many years ago, but decided to try something a little
different. I ended up resuming my studies in biochemistry instead after
thinking more about how I could maximize my impact in the world. As I've taken
my biology and chemistry requirements (I just wrapped up organic chemistry
literally yesterday), I am increasingly sure that biosciences are where I
belong.

I have deep experience at Pivotal and VMware in process improvement for
engineering. I led a team delivering tools for improving customer experience
around cloud service monitoring. At MEPCAD, I developed and shipped a
green-field fire protection software product driving over $1 million in revenue
in the first year of sales. Making an impact is important to me, and I hope to
keep driving this sort of outcome for my fellow scientists.

Thank you for your time and consideration,
David Timm
